1. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
It is not allowed in Java because both title and category are type String, so the constructors method to build a 
DVD by title and category have the same signature (same names and same data types of parameters)
